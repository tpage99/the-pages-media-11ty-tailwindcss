  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    We're Taylor and Kendra Page. A husband and wife team that love to spend time working on projects together and making our local Springfield community better. We moved to the Springfield area from Ohio for college and loved it so much - we stayed! Now we're raising a family here and we're determined to help local businesses succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    We like to help local area businesses in Springfield, Missouri reach their potential by helping them get in front of their clients. We are all neighbors, after all.
  </p>
  <h2>Why You Should Work with Us.</h2>
  <h3>We're not your typical tech people.</h3>
  <p>
    We won't talk to you about Javascript frameworks or [insert random tech term here] and expect you to care or understand anything about it. We went to school to learn how to talk, and more importantly, how to listen to people.
  </p> 
  <h3>
    You need to be online.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Maybe you've been doing ok with what you've got or without a website until now but the truth is you're missing out on customers without some sort of digital storefront. This gives customers an opportunity to learn more about you at their own pace.
  </p>
  <h3>We actually like this stuff.</h3>
  <p>
    The more time you spend working on your online presence yourself, is time away from doing the thing you love - your business. Let us help. We love technology and leveraging it to help businesses become more efficient and profitable.
  </p>
  <h3>
    We've got plenty more reasons why you should work with us, but maybe that's best over a coffee.
  </h3>    
  <p>
    Whether it's a solution for your social media presence or getting a website up and running, we can help you become more connected with your customers.
