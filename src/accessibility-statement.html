  <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
  <p>Accessibility in web development is very important to me. Before I was a web developer, I was a social worker working with individuals with developmental disabilities. It is important to me to provide an accessible experience to individuals of all abilities in everything I build.</p>
  <p>In spite of this commitment and desire to ensure no one is excluded, I'm not perfect.</p> 
  <p>I do my best to adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines but this doesn't mean that this will meet everyone's needs and abilities. If you have any difficulty in accessing any part of my website, please send me an email at taylor@thepagesmedia.com so I can do better.</p>
