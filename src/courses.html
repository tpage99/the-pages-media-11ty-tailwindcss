  <p>Thanks so much for stopping by!</p>
  <p>I'm still in the process of developing live course curriculum for existing and soon-to-be Shopify merchants.</p>
  <p>In my time as a Shopify Expert, I've worked with hundreds of merchants and seen or <em>fixed</em> many of the same problems over and over again. The idea behind creating these live courses is that you can get ahead of these problems <em>before they happen</em> and not have to worry about calling a developer and Shopify Expert like me to fix it.</p>
